## Design

-  ### Color scheme

As the Hero Image is the focal point when entering the website, I opted to keep the overall color scheme quite small. And since it is about currency a. k. a. money, I gravitated towards the green color palette. To make sure the green does not become overwhelmning I chose a gradient green color for the Header and Footer, but kept the rest of the colors in neutral grey.

- Colors
  - I used #00cc66 ,#009933 for Header and Footer
  - I used #f2f2f2 for the navigation bar
  - I used #9ea09f, #121413 for all underlines
  - I used #e0e0e0 for the back to top

- ### Typography

The fonts used throughout the website was imported from W3Schools. They are all arial/sans sarif. I used font family to be able to keep the same text style throughout the website.

- Text colors
  - I used #FFFFFF for inside Header and Footer, to make sure sufficient contrasting
  - I used #505250 for the sites different section headlines
  - I used #242524d8 for the welcome text above the hero image
  - I used #000000 for the text in the different sections and navigation bar

- ### Imagery

Given the website's focus on cryptocurrency, I aimed for a hero image that not only clearly represents the website's subject matter but also serves as an educational resource. This led me to select an image featuring various cryptocurrency logos, with each brand listed in the image description.

The other two images were chosen as they suited the overall design, color scheme and content. They also have a bit of playfullness to them which I think goes well with beginner-friendly theme of the website.

## Wireframes

Wireframes was created for desktop using balsamiq. 

*Although wireframe only was created for desktop, the responsiveness on different screensizes were considered and resolved through media queries*

- Github - Used to host and deploy the website
- VScode - Used initially to write and test code 
- Paint - Used to resize images for readme content

## Accessibility

Throughout the developing of the website it has been of importance to ensure that it is as accessible as possible. This was achieved by:

  - Using semantic markup HTML
  - Using a hover function on all areas in the header, to make sure the user knows what its specific use is
  - Using a sans serif font, that is suitable for people with reading disabilities
  - Using colors that are contrasting to make it easy to read

- *CSS*
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

### Browser testing

### Bugs

During the testing of responsiveness on different dimensions, there was an issue that effects the hero image, the image description and underlines so they do not adhere to the 100% width across all devices. The issue was resolved using media query for stacking elements when under 768 pixels.

Images could not upload in the beginning. It was resolved when I changed the location and gave the realtive path.

Many small design flaws, which I throughout the project resolved.
